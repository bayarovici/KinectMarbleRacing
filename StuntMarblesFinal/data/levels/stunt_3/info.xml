  <name>Stunt Marble Racers: the wall</name>
  <pos>22</pos>
  <info>This track is a little bit different than the other "stunt marble racers" tracks. It provides a shortcut, a wall, that will be teared down by the first player heading for the finish line. And: it's not really a fast race level.</info>
