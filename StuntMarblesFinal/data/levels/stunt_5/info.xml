  <name>Stunt Marble Racers: triangle jump</name>
  <pos>24</pos>
  <info>This track's shape is a triangle. It features fast corners and three different jumps on each of the short straights. But beware: you will lose a lot of time once you leave the track (e.g. because you took a jump too fast).</info>
