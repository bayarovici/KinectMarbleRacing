  <info>On this track you will find a high jump that you have to jump with the right speed, because there is a checkpoint you have to pass by jumping. Figure out the right speed to reach that checkpoint (around 30), because the rest of the track is quite simple. Just a steep turn and a high speed passage.</info>
